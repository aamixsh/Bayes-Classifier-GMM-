| Bayes Classifier using GMM |
------------------------------
Author: Aayush Mishra

This repository consists of programs to build Bayes Classifiers using Gaussian Mixture Modelling.
It was built as Assignment-2 of CS-669 Pattern Recognition course at IIT Mandi, Fall 2017.

The programs are contained in the directory src/py

To run the programs, use python2. (example command - "python test_text.py")

There are three sets of programs.
1.	text: You can train and test text data in the format present in sample text files in the data/Input folder.
2.	images:
	2.a. Colored images, their feature extraction in two formats, viz. Color Histogram and Bag-of-Visual-Words by non-overlapping patches, training, and testing.
	2.b. Black and White images, their feature extraction by overlapping patches, training and testing. 
Specifications are mentioned in the programs themselves. You'll be instructed what to do once you run the program.

The input directory is data/Input
You can put more data in the prescribed format and run the programs for it.

The output directory is data/Output
It will contain all extracted features, files related to training models, and test results for future reference.

As the data can be huge to process, the programs may run for long times.
Also, the programs have been tested for a lot of times, but errors may still be present. Feedbacks will be appreciated.
